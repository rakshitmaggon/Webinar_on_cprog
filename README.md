There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

### Prerequisites

If you are just getting started with GitHub then I recommended you to read [this](https://github.com/wimpywarlord/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md) document. This is for when you look forward to making small changes and pull requests.

In case you want a comprehensive understanding of GitHub and want to become a long term contributor to this project, I recommend reading [this]( https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) document.

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

Optionally I recommend you to download **Sublime text** 3.Its a amazing free editor from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```
